# CriticalDimension26
Semester Project in String Theory: Complete derivation of the commutator of Lorentz generators.

## Abstract
String theory has the potential to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics. One of its
advantages is that it has relatively few tunable parameters, offering a form of uniqueness. For
instance, the number of spacetime dimensions is derived from the theory rather than being an
assumption. This thesis, primarily following the notation from "A First Course in String Theory" by
Barton Zwiebach, provides a brief review of the preliminaries and explicitly calculates the commutator
of Lorentz generators $[ M^{− I} , M^{− J} ]$ to determine the critical dimension and normal ordering constant
of bosonic open string theory.
